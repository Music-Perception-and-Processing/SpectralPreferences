+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+ 
1. Analyze
The Analyze script can be used to create plots and extract results from the result files for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Outputs are created within the directories.
* "Output Files": This directory includes tables for each experiment, comprising the behavioral data of each subject and outcomes of the linear mixed effect models. 
* "Plot": This directory contains plots that illustrate the method and results of the experiments.

2. GenSig
The GenSig script can be used to create stimuli employing the method used in our experiment. In lines 6 to 7, options can be defined to adjust sound level output and specify which frequency bands to include or exclude.
